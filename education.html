                <h3>Education Background</h3>
                <p>When I first arrived in the Netherlands, I attended the ISK language school, which helped me adapt to a new language and culture. 
               After that, I continued my education in secondary school (havo) and earned my diploma. 
               During high school, I followed informatics classes, which sparked my interest in ICT. 
               For my final school project (PWS), I created a Visual Novel Game in Ren'Py, exploring the topic of teaching moral and ethical values to children aged 8â€“12.</p>

                 <h3>Why Hbo-ICT?</h3>
                 <p>I chose HBO-ICT because I enjoy problem-solving, programming, and working on creative projects. 
                    ICT allows me to combine technical knowledge with creativity, and I look forward to deepening my skills in programming languages, software development, project management, and teamwork.</p>

                 <h3>My Expectations</h3>
                 <p>Through this program, I expect to gain strong technical knowledge, including programming languages and software development. 
                    I also want to improve essential skills such as project management, teamwork, communication, analytical thinking, and problem-solving. 
                    In addition, I hope this study will give me the confidence to apply my knowledge in real-world projects and prepare me for a successful career in ICT.
                    In the future, I would like to apply my knowledge and skills in the field of software development. My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects that combine technology with creativity, while continuing to grow both professionally and personally.</p>
